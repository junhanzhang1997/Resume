        I worded as salesman in T-Mobile (sale network and phone call service to customers).

    <h3>Casino corporation</h3>
    <p>
        I also worked in casino, and my task is keep watching the game and make sure the game running correctly. For example, making sure card dealer pay out correctly, and the house way that dealer set correctly. Especially, the game called “Double hand”, it includes seven cards in one hand, dealer usually set the hand fast, so it requires you take glance of the hands and recognize what kind of hand immediately. This job needs me to highly pay attention on the game. This working experience trains me to be highly sensitive to something incorrect such as BUGs when I am coding.
